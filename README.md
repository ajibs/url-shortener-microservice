# URL Shortener Microservice

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to https://little-url.herokuapp.com/

## Requirements

* User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

* User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

* User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

## Result

You can view the live version the app on: https://ajibs-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/
